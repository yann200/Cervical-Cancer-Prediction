CERVICAL CANCER PREDICTION

In this hands-on project, we will build and train an XGBoost model to predict cervical
cancer in 858 patients

The dataset was collected at hospital Universitario de caracas in caracas venezuela and 
contains demographic informations habits, and historic medical record of 858 patients

Cervical cancer kills about 4000 women in the US and about 300.000 women worldwide. Due to 
increased medical screening, cervical cancer death rate has been reduced by 74% from 1955 to 1922

Studies have shown that high sexual activity Human papilloma virus (HPV) is one of the key factors
that increased the risk of having cervical cancer

The presence of hormones in oral contraceptives having many children and smoking increase the risk for
developping cervical cancer, particularly in women infected with HPV. Also, people with weak immune systems
(HIV/AIDS) have high risk of HPV.
